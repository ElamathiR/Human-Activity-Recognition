# Human-Activity-Recognition

Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a crucial field in computer vision and artificial intelligence,
aiming to automatically identify and classify human actions from video sequences. The ability to
recognise activities accurately has widespread applications in healthcare, surveillance, sports
analytics, human-computer interaction, and autonomous systems. However, achieving high
recognition accuracy in real-world scenarios remains a challenging task due to variations in
lighting, background clutter, viewpoint changes, and occlusions.
This project focuses on developing a deep learning-based HAR system capable of recognising 10
Specific human activities from video data. By leveraging custom CNN models, pretrained
architectures (such as ResNet), and retrieval-augmented learning, the goal is to improve
classification accuracy and make HAR models more robust and generalizable across diverse
datasets.
